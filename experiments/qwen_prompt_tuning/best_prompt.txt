Use the photo as a strict composition reference: preserve the silhouette, pose, and framing without adding or swapping limbs. If only part of the body is visible, keep only that visible portion. Convert to adorable chibi-style, very-low-resolution pixel art in a bead-grid style with solid bright colors, no gradients, and no background.
