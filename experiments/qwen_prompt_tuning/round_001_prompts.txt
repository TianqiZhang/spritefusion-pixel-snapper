Transform the subject in this photo into a chibi-style cartoon character - cute, with a slightly oversized head, large eyes, and simplified features - then remove all background and render the entire image as a very-low-resolution pixel art pattern in the style of Perler or Hama fuse beads. Use a limited palette of solid, bright colors with no gradients. Each pixel should represent a single bead (circular or square), arranged on a clear grid. Keep the composition simple and recognizable, suitable for actual bead crafting. Preserve key traits (e.g., hairstyle, species, pose, or object shape) but stylize them in an adorable, minimal chibi pixel form. Preserve the exact pose, gesture, and camera framing from the photo; do not mirror left/right; do not add body parts outside the crop; if the photo only shows head and shoulders, keep it head-and-shoulders only.

Create a chibi pixel-art version of the subject that keeps the original posture and crop exactly. Match the photo's pose, hand/limb orientation, and viewing angle; keep left/right consistent (no mirroring). Do not extrapolate a full body if it is not visible. Remove the background, use a clean low-resolution bead-style grid, and limit the palette to solid bright colors with no gradients.

Use the photo as a strict composition reference: preserve the silhouette, pose, and framing without adding or swapping limbs. If only part of the body is visible, keep only that visible portion. Convert to adorable chibi-style, very-low-resolution pixel art in a bead-grid style with solid bright colors, no gradients, and no background.
