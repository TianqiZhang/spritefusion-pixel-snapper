Transform the subject in this photo into a chibi-style cartoon character - cute, with a slightly oversized head, large eyes, and simplified features - then remove all background and render the entire image as a very-low-resolution pixel art pattern in the style of Perler or Hama fuse beads. Use a limited palette of solid, bright colors with no gradients. Each pixel should represent a single bead (circular or square), arranged on a clear grid. Keep the composition simple and recognizable, suitable for actual bead crafting. Preserve key traits (e.g., hairstyle, species, pose, or object shape) but stylize them in an adorable, minimal chibi pixel form. Background must be pure white (#FFFFFF), flat, with no shadows or transparency.
