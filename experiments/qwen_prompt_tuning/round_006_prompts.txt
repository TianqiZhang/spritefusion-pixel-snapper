Remove all background, transform the subject in this photo into chibi-style low-resolution pixel art, cute, and simplified features. Preserve key traits (e.g., hairstyle, species, pose, or object shape) but stylize them in an adorable, minimal low-resolution chibi pixel form. Render the entire image as a low-resolution pixel art pattern in the style of Perler or Hama fuse beads. Use a limited palette of solid, bright colors, with no anti-aliasing, no smoothing, no gradients between cells. Arranged on a precise 32*32, 48*48 or 64*64 pixel grid
